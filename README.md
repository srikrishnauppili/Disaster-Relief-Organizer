# Disaster-Relief-Organizer

Summary:

Natural disasters cause a huge havoc and one of the major problems during these disasters is improper information management with respect to relief materials such as water, food, etc. In the recent floods of Kerala and Chennai, there were several messages in social  networking websites asking for specific help at certain relief sites. But most of them old, not valid or false messages. What if there was a system to organize this entire process of relief materials gathering and making them reach the right people. So this project is aimed at creating a system which can act as an intermediary between people who have been affected by disaster areas, government officials who survey the disaster affected area, and the people living in the non-affected areas who are willing to help. This system will provide information on the current needs, validate them and match them with suitable benefactors.


Goals:

1). To get instantaneous real-time knowledge of the needs of the affected area <br>
2). To reduce the overall time taken for the relief materials to reach the affected areas by intelligently pooling resources <br>
3). To provide high levels of transparency for the benefactor in terms of where/how the relief materials are used <br>
4). To have high levels of confidence on the legitimacy of a particular need in an area via Machine Learning and crowd sourcing. <br>
5). Mobilize and organize the relief needs of the affected area so that it makes it easier for the rest of the world to help. <br>

Core features:

The core features of the system include the following: <br>
1). An interface for letting people post their needs in the affected area <br>
2). A system to display the real-time needs of the various parts of the affected area <br>
3). A mechanism to verify the claims using Machine Learning, authorized sources, and crowd sourcing <br>
4). An interface for the benefactor can provide a budget for which the system can suggest the ideal places to donate to <br>
5). A system to maintain and assign priority to the various requirements <br>
6). A SMS based claims generation system for areas with no connectivity <br>
7). A system to verify that the claims are deprecated and no longer valid <br>

Alternatives:
 anyone after hearing this idea would think that these things can be done using social networking sites ,but there are many drawbacks
1.rumors
some people may send old messages and may create an unwanted problem 
cheat the people that they are in necessity for food or other requirements
2 .online
if a disaster happens,it us obvious that there won't be any network for at least 3 to 4 days after recivery.hence it is impossible for the people to ask for help from the helping hands.
so if an application is designed to allow only those people after verification to post messages for help so the people who are helping will not be cheated
